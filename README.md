# CPSC 5540 Project 2: Simplex algorithm

This implementation was developed by Jonathan Chen and Hridhay Suresh.

## Requirements

This program is written in **Python 3.14**. It may work on earlier versions too.

This program also requires the `numpy` library version 2.2.6, which can be installed through `pip install numpy`. It is recommended to run in a virtual environment or conda environment containing numpy. No other libraries are needed.

## Quick Start

To test on a benchmark 1, run `python simplex.py "benchmarks/sat/bench1.txt"`.

For convenience we have included `./run_tests.sh` which runs over all benchmarks. This shell file can be executed directly after `chmod +x run_tests.sh`, or indirectly via `sh run_tests.sh`.
